# React-Sweeper
# Training Sample during my learning/praticing in React/Javascript programming language
This game is based on famously Minesweeper from Microsoft Windows XP. The basic rule of the game is there will be a grid with N * N columns and rows, along with N bombs hidden somewhere in the grid. Each tile in the grid (except those contain bomb) will be labelled with the value that suggest the total number of bombs in surrounded tiles (8, 3 upper, 1 on left and right and 3 in the below). In order to win this game, player have to find and open all the tiles that free from bomb, action include Left-Click to open tile, Right-Click to Flag a tile which imply that tile contain bomb .

Player can adjust to number of columns/rows and the number of bombs that will be create and planted into the grid (The still some error in this process, but mostly is the real number of bombs didn't fit the expectation. I'll work on this later)
If player accidentaly open the bomb tile, the game is over

Source code is derived from hamzanadeveloper major changed and modifiy to follow the game rules
